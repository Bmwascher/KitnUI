# digit: "pre-v828" and "backup_v828" block, "savev828" does not, because a
# letter running into the v means this is an identifier and not a stamp. At
# least two digits, so a v1 style major stays out. Nothing a reader can open

# vocabulary trips them: "augmentation 2026" is not a date. Numeric forms come
# in either order and take / - or . as the separator, but the SAME separator
# twice: "0.4-1.15" is a clamped range, not a date. A four-digit year settles
# a triple on its own. A two-digit year needs one component that can be a
# month and another that can be a day, and drops the dot, or version strings
# like "8.6.10" read as dates; that constraint is also what keeps spell range
# and rank lists such as 30/33/36 out. A rank triple in date shape, 5/10/15,
# is the one false positive left, and --no-verify covers it. The bounds are
# digit boundaries rather than word boundaries, or a timestamp and a
# filename stamp slip through: T and _ are word characters.

# comments. Resuming at the remaining text is what handles several blocks on
